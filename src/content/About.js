                <p>I Am actually a medical student with a great passion for computer sciences.
                    I am a self-taught programmer and My main goal is to learn software engineering
                    and Web Development, to create something that will help people, mostly people who are in need
                    of medical services. I am still a beginner in this field,
                    but I am trying to learn new things and improve my skills.
