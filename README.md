# Resume

A simple resume/portfolio single-page application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

following this nice [example](https://github.com/naaficodes/Portfolio_Website_ReactJS) and adapting it to this project.

- fixed multiple errors and warnings
- updated the routing
- minor changes to the styling...

This is a quick project to learn a bit more about react, and display a bit more about me.
