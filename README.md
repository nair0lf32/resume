# Resume

A simple resume/portfolio single-page application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

following a nice [example/template](https://github.com/naaficodes/Portfolio_Website_ReactJS) and adapting it a bit by:

- fixing multiple console errors and warnings
- updating the react routing method
- doing minor changes to the styling and the layout...

This is a quick project to learn a bit more about react (and display a bit more about me, lol)

This is public mostly because It's served github pages
